MAPS

mp_backlot
mp_crash
mp_crossfire
mp_citystreet
mp_strike
Each team will choose one map from the above map pool before the start of the match. A knife round will decide which map is played first - winner gets to choose.


SIDE SELECTION

Side selection will be decided by a knife round on each map where the winner will decide whether to attack or defend first. If anyone on the opposite team is injured by gunfire or grenade damage during the knife round the offending team forfeits the bash.

Note - In LAN tournaments side selection will be decided by a coin toss. 


NUMBER OF MAPS


Note - In LAN tournaments only one map will be played and that map decided by removing of maps from the pool of 5 official maps until only one map remains. Each team gets to remove two maps from the pool. A coin toss will decide who removes the first map (Loser of the coin toss removes the first map so the winner gets the chance to remove the last map from the remaining two maps).  

CALLING A WIN

First to reach 13 rounds wins the match.


TIE BREAKER

If both teams have an equal number of map wins at the end of two maps played, a tie breaker map will be played where the winner of that map will win the match. The tie breaker map will be selected by a knife round where winners pick the map. Again the sides for the map will be decided by a knife round and the number of rounds reduced to mr3. If the first tie breaker ends up as a draw same map will be played and sides will be changed (e.g.: first tie breaker match team who attacked first now have to defend first).

Note - In LAN tournaments, both the map and the side selection decided by two coin tosses.

Intentional disconnection: any connection loss between opponents due to a player‟s actions. Upon judgment by the referee, the offending player may be charged with a default loss.

2. A referee will inform the players on exactly how many minutes must still be played in order to complete the match.

UNFAIR PLAY
The following actions will be considered unfair play:
1. the use of any cheat program
2. an intentional disconnection
3. the use of any settings exceeding the standard and permitted settings
4. any “unnecessary chatting” during the match.

“Unnecessary chatting” means any chatting other than the cases listed below:
i. greeting messages between the players;
ii. repeat of “P” to request for a pause during a stage match;
iii. a signal for the loss (i.e.: „gg‟, „GG‟, or any other message that the referee can use to decide the winner);
iv. chatting between players that does not violate the unsportsmanlike behavior clause;
v. any message that the referee can judge as part of the game.

5. clearly allowing one‟s opponent to win a match.
6. if a referee decides that external conditions (Press, Team Leader, Player, Spectator, etc) are giving or have given an
unfair advantage to a player, the player may be given a warning or lose by default at the referee‟s sole discretion.
7. unsportsmanlike behavior or, in general, disruptive (e.g., shouting), inappropriate and/or unprofessional actions
directed towards another player (even inside the game).
8. the use of a program bug that is determined by the board of referees as being unfair.

Upon discovery of any player committing any violations regarded as unfair play, the offending player, at the sole discretion of the board of referees, may receive a warning, a forfeit loss or, in extreme cases, be disqualified from the tournament.

The player may request to pause the game by raising his hand. One must be in possession of the ball and be one's own half before requesting to pause the game. After reviewing the reason for a pause, if the referee deems the pause unnecessary the referee may decide to issue a warning or loss by default decision.
