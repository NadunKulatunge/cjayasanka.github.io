CLASSES

A team with five players can use a maximum of:
One (1) Sniper
One (1) Demolition
Two (2) SMG
Five (5) Assault


MAPS

mp_backlot
mp_crash
mp_crossfire
mp_citystreet
mp_strike
Each team will choose one map from the above map pool before the start of the match. A knife round will decide which map is played first - winner gets to choose.


SIDE SELECTION

Side selection will be decided by a knife round on each map where the winner will decide whether to attack or defend first. If anyone on the opposite team is injured by gunfire or grenade damage during the knife round the offending team forfeits the bash.

Note - In LAN tournaments side selection will be decided by a coin toss. 


NUMBER OF MAPS

Two maps will be played per match. Starting with the knife round winners map, and then followed by the knife round losers map.

Note - In LAN tournaments only one map will be played and that map decided by removing of maps from the pool of 5 official maps until only one map remains. Each team gets to remove two maps from the pool. A coin toss will decide who removes the first map (Loser of the coin toss removes the first map so the winner gets the chance to remove the last map from the remaining two maps).  

CALLING A WIN

First to reach 13 rounds wins the match.


TIE BREAKER

If both teams have an equal number of map wins at the end of two maps played, a tie breaker map will be played where the winner of that map will win the match. The tie breaker map will be selected by a knife round where winners pick the map. Again the sides for the map will be decided by a knife round and the number of rounds reduced to mr3. If the first tie breaker ends up as a draw same map will be played and sides will be changed (e.g.: first tie breaker match team who attacked first now have to defend first).

Note - In LAN tournaments, both the map and the side selection decided by two coin tosses. 


WALKOVERS AND PUNCTUALITY

It is the responsibility of the team captain to ensure that his team is on the match server at the time the match is set to be played, and with the minimum number of required eligible players, which is 3 (three).
